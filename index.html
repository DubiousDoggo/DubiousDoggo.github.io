    <h2>A collection of things I've created</h2>
    
    <h3>5.26.2025</h3>
    <p>
        So, here we are;
        swirling around this great big soup.
        the soup of the universe; universe soup.
        The date is 5.26.12025, A.D. -----<br />
        A lot has changed in the last 10000 years.
        by my estimate, an exponential amount of things.
        I work in the coal mines of "Earth 2.0", to use a 2000's-ism
        tonight when I got off my shift I went up on over to BigHill for a dusting,
        got my suit all nice and clean. hacked out a lung too in their clean air
        box before smoking a bowl to clear my head - guess <i>some</i> things never change.
