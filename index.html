        BEGIN REPORT FROM GLEBA

            Yumako production is going well. we have automated production of 
        artificial Yumako soil, greatly expanding the farmable area. --------
        The construction robots sent from the previous NAVUIS shipment are being 
        used to sod the Yumako marshland and construct addtional farming towers.

            A second rail station has been constructed to transport landfill 
        from FT. JELLYNUT to YUMAKO CITY. This station, along with a new 
        personnel tram, now share the rail line linking the two loctions.

            By reccomendation of <abbr title="Cheif Puppy of Engineering">CPE</abbr> a second rail line should be constructed 
        if the yeild time exceeds 30 seconds, to minimize Yumak mash spoilage 
        in transit to FT. JELLYNUT.

            I've attached some aerial photographs of YUMAKO CITY that we took while
        scoping out the location of the new passenger rail station, and a transit
        map with the proposed locations.

    <h4>5.26.2025</h4>
    <p>
        So, here we are;
        swirling around this great big soup.
        the soup of the universe; universe soup.
        The date is 5.26.12025, A.D.<br>
        A lot has changed in the last 10000 years.
        by my estimate, an exponential amount of things.
        I work in the coal mines of "Earth 2.0", to use a 2000's-ism.<br>
        tonight when I got off my shift I went up on over to BigHill for a dusting,
        got my suit all nice and clean. hacked out a lung too in their clean air
        box before smoking a bowl to clear my head &mdash; guess <i>some</i> things never change.
