        So, here we are;
        swirling around this great big soup.
        the soup of the universe; universe soup.
        The date is 5.26.12025, A.D.<br>
        A lot has changed in the last 10000 years.
        by my estimate, an exponential amount of things.
        I work in the coal mines of "Earth 2.0", to use a 2000's-ism.<br>
        tonight when I got off my shift I went up on over to BigHill for a dusting,
        got my suit all nice and clean. hacked out a lung too in their clean air
        box before smoking a bowl to clear my head &mdash; guess <i>some</i> things never change.

        BEGIN REPORT FROM GLEBA

            Yumako production is going well. we have automated production of 
        artificial Yumako soil, greatly expanding the farmable area. --------
        The construction robots sent from the previous NAVUIS shipment are being 
        used to sod the Yumako marshland and construct addtional farming towers.

            A second rail station has been constructed to transport landfill 
        from FT. JELLYNUT to YUMAKO CITY. This station, along with a new 
        personnel tram, now share the rail line linking the two loctions.

            By reccomendation of <abbr title="Cheif Puppy of Engineering">CPE</abbr> a second rail line should be constructed 
        if the yeild time exceeds 30 seconds, to minimize Yumak mash spoilage 
        in transit to FT. JELLYNUT.

            I've attached some aerial photographs of YUMAKO CITY that we took while
        scoping out the location of the new passenger rail station, and a transit
        map with the proposed locations.

        BEGIN REPORT FROM GLEBA

            An addtional rail stop has been constructed in YUMAKO CITY, linking 
        it directly to the Jellynut farm in FT. JELLYNUT. Jellynut processing 
        has begun on site. Due to the relative stability of the unprocessed nut,
        as compared to the Yumako mash and the processed nut jelly, in-transit
        spoilage has been drasticlly reduced.
        
            The combined freshness of both the Yumako mash and nut Jelly has 
        resulted in an approximate 50% increase in the freshness of the resulting 
        products, such as bioflux. As such, by reccomendation of CPE, all future 
        biological processing is to take place at YUMAKO CITY, with non-spoilable end 
        products possibly being shipped back to FT. JELLYNUT for further processing.
        
            As part of the agreement between YUMAKO CITY and FT. JELLYNUT, all 
        Jellynut seeds from processing at the YUMAKO site are shipped back to 
        FT. JELLYNUT for replanting.

        REPORT FROM FT. JELLYNUT.
        
        >>>>> A REQUEST HAS BEEN SUBMITTED TO NAVIIUS SUPPLY FOR 
                        CANNON SHELL x 100.

        Due to the increase in demand for Jellynut from YUMAKO CITY, Jellynut
        production has increased. The resulting increase in released spores 
        from the Jellynut farming process has been significant. Based on our
        estimates the spore cloud has not yet reached the local fauna; it is
        however becomming dangerously close to the nearest raft of pentapod.
        
        We are currently lacking in defence capability, and would be unable to
        subdue the pentapod should they become aware of the farm's location.
        Local production of cannon shells had been prevented thus far by the 
        lack of coal on the surface of GLEBA. Further research will need to be 
        conducted on methods of coal synthesis in order to bring local explosives
        production online.
        
        As such, we request armaments imminately.

        REPORT FROM GLEBA
        
        The pentapod colony nearest to FT. JELLYNUT has been terminated. The 
        cannon shells provided from NAVIUS proved most useful in this endevour.
        Permanent autonomous defenses will need to be constructed before GLEBA 
        can be left without supervision.
        
        Work on spacefligt from GLEBA continues. Production of engine units at
        FT. JELLYNUT has begun, and bio-lubricant processing has begun at YUMAKO
        CITY. Due to the iron demand of the engine units, iron smelting facilities
        have been expanded. However, iron production is now bottlenecked by iron
        bacteria cultivation, in part due to lack of fresh nutrients on site at
        FT. JELLYNUT. As such, a new bacteria cultivation center is being constructed
        in YUMAKO CITY. 
        
        Two new rail stations are under construction at YUMAKO CITY, one for export
        of iron ore and bacteria, and one for lubricant in preparation for electric
        engine production at FT. JELLYNUT.
